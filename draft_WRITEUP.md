ABOUT:
    
    These scripts run the Ticker LED matrix on a PocketBeagle and includes several
    interactive widgets for the device.

SETUP:

    A. CHANGE FROM RPROC TO UIO via Cloud9 terminal
    
        cd /boot                            [to move to /boot directory]
        sudo nano uEnv.txt                  [to edit /boot/uEnv.txt]
        -                                   [make modifications; under PRU OPTIONS, comment out PRU RPROC line and uncomment PRU UIO line]
        ^X                                  ["ctrl+X" to exit editor]
        Y                                   ["Y" to save modified buffer]
        -                                   ["enter" to confirm file name]
        -                                   [shut off and restart the PocketBeagle to make PRU changes]

    B. CONNECT TO INTERNET via Cloud9 terminal
    
        Option 1. Using USB connection to a Mac computer:
    
        sudo dhclient usb1              [connect to internet using other computer]

        ^C                              ["ctrl+C" to quit checking internet connection]
    
        Option 2: Using USB connection to a Windows computer:
        
        /sbin/route add default gw 192.168.7.1
        echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8" >> /etc/resolv.conf
        
        Option 3. Using USB WiFi adapter:
    
        lsusb                           [to interact with USB WiFi adapter]
        sudo connmanctl                 [to modify WiFi connection]
            enable wifi                 [enables WiFi]
            scan wifi                   [scans for available networks]
            services                    [view available networks]
            agent on                    [turn on agent]
            connect [network ID]        [connect to network; use network ID not network name]
                                        [enter network password if required]
            services                    [check *AR or *AO next to network to indicate connected]
            quit                        [quit interface]
        ping google.com                 [check internet connection]
        ^C                              ["ctrl+C" to quit checking internet connection]

    C. IMPORTING PACKAGES via Cloud9 terminal

        mkdir logs                          [make logs folder]
        sudo crontab -e                     [open crontab]
        -                                   [make modifications; add this line:
                                                @reboot sleep 60 && sh /var/lib/cloud9/projects/ticker/ticker_automatic.sh > /var/lib/cloud9/logs/cronlog 2>&1
                                            ]
        ^X                                  ["ctrl+X" to exit editor]
        Y                                   ["Y" to save modified buffer]
        -                                   ["enter" to confirm file name]
        -                                   [shut off and restart the PocketBeagle to make cron changes]

RUN:
    
    Restart the PocketBeagle before first run to ensure PRU changes have been set.
    Ensure the device is connected to a 5V/4A DC power source and the power switch
    has been set to "on".
    
    cd /var/lib/cloud9/projects/ticker  [to move to ticker directory]
    sudo python3 ticker.py              [to run ticker.py]
    -                                   [enter password, likely "temppwd"]
                                        
    On first run, paste the access token URL from spotify_setup.py when
    prompted in the Cloud9 terminal. This URL can only be used once (must
    regenerate a new one using spotify_setup.py if needed).
